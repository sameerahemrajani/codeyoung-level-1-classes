        <h1> Debugging</h1>
        <p> ● Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run, like the Rust error shown above. These are usually easy to fix as long as you are familiar with the language's syntax and know what the error messages mean. </p>
        <p> ● Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct, but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that the program runs incorrectly. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.</p>
